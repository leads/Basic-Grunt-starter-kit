# Basic Grunt starter kit

##How to get going
You'll need node and grunt. 
In the command-line
`npm install` 
then `grunt`
and you're up and running - new tab will open in your default browser on port 8000.

##What it does
It uses Browsersync for live reloads; 
Sass for CSS;
HTML lint;
JS Hint

##Issue:
- Browsersync can sometimes take a little while to open index.html once you've ran `grunt`
